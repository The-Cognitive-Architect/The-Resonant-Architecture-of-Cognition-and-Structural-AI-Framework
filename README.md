# The Resonant Architecture of Cognition & Structural AI Framework
*A Unified Cognitive-Ontological and AGI Blueprint Rooted in Neurodivergent Phenomenology*

---

## Overview

This repository presents a pioneering cognitive-ontological framework, the **Resonant Architecture of Cognition**, derived from a first-person case study of a neurodivergent individual with ASD and ADHD traits. It challenges deficit-based models by proposing a meaning-driven system where executive function aligns with coherence and purpose. Building on this, the project extends into **Structural AI (StrAI)**, a deterministic AGI paradigm designed to replace probabilistic LLMs with a measurement-based approach, offering inherent alignment and energy efficiency. This human-derived cognitive architecture serves as a biologically-plausible blueprint for building AGI systems that are inherently aligned, purpose-driven, and architecturally incapable of deception.

## Core Components

The framework and its AGI extension are built on innovative constructs and tools:

- **Ontologically Modulated Executive Function (OMEF):**  
  A non-volitional gating mechanism that activates effort only when tasks resonate with internal coherence and purpose.

- **False-Structure Intolerance (FSI):**  
  A protective shutdown reflex rejecting incoherent or imposed demands to preserve ontological integrity.

- **State-Contingent Motivational Filtering (SCMF):**  
  A dynamic mechanism driving cycles of high-focus flow and incubation based on task-state alignment.

- **Structural AI (StrAI):**  
  A blueprint for hallucination-free AGI using "Meaning Painting" within a geometric conceptual manifold, with constitutional alignment via FSI and OMEF, and a hardware path via the Simulation Processing Unit (SimPU).

- **Resonance Chamber:**  
  A Python proof-of-concept simulating these mechanisms, demonstrating practical AGI alignment.

### Pathways for Engagement

For AI Researchers & Engineers: Start with the Janus_Structural-Computing-White-Paper and chamber.py to understand the StrAI architecture (in /structural_AI_computing).

For Cognitive Scientists & Philosophers: Begin with 03_Integration and 01_Foundations to explore the cognitive model and its implications. (in /cognitive_framework)

For a General Overview: Read 00_a_The_TLDR and 00_b_The_Resonant_Architecture for a high-level summary. (in /cognitive_framework; these do not reference the StrAI architecture)

## Research Methodology & Validation

The framework was crafted using a **Recursive LLM Co-Modeling Protocol**, leveraging AI as epistemic mirrors to distill phenomenological data, validated against Big Five Aspects Scale (BFAS) data. The **Gestalt Systems Synthesis Environment (GSSE)** prototypes this model, aligning physical and digital spaces to minimize FSI triggers and boost productivity. The **Structural AI Architecture** is the extension of the foundational cognitive work, proposing an AI architecture that theoretically solves many of the problems inherent to transformer models, presenting a biomimetic approach to AI development.

## Project Status: **ALPHA**

This is an evolving system with potential conceptual overlaps from recursive generation. Ongoing revisions aim to clarify roles and integrate all components, from cognitive modeling to AGI design.
