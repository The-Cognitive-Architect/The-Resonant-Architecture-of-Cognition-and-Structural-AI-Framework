# The Resonant Architecture of Cognition
*A Unified Cognitive Ontological Framework Rooted in Neurodivergent Phenomenology*

---

## Introduction

This collection of documents presents a novel cognitive-ontological framework, termed the **Resonant Architecture of Cognition**, derived from an intensive, first-person case study of a neurodivergent individual with traits of ASD and ADHD. This work challenges traditional, deficit-based models of cognition by proposing a self-consistent, alternative architecture where executive function is not driven by conventional willpower, but is instead modulated by an intrinsic alignment with personal meaning, coherence, and authenticity.

---

## Core Constructs

The framework is built upon three core constructs that describe a cognitive system in which meaning serves as the primary catalyst for action and thought:

- **Ontologically Modulated Executive Function (OMEF):**  
  A non-volitional executive gating mechanism wherein effort is only initiated and sustained when tasks resonate with internal coherence and purpose.

- **False-Structure Intolerance (FSI):**  
  A protective shutdown reflex that activates in response to perceived incoherence or meaningless demands, rejecting false or externally imposed structures.

- **State-Contingent Motivational Filtering (SCMF):**  
  A dynamic motivational gating mechanism that produces alternating cycles of high-focus flow and incubation, depending on alignment between task and internal state.

---

## Methodology

The framework was developed using a **Recursive LLM Co-Modeling Protocol**, where the author utilized multiple AI systems as epistemic mirrors to distill phenomenological data into symbolic constructs, which were then empirically validated against Big Five Aspects Scale (BFAS) data.

### Prototype: Gestalt Systems Synthesis Environment (GSSE)

The **GSSE** is a physical and digital architecture designed to support this model. It minimizes cognitive friction (FSI triggers) and maximizes productivity by aligning space, stimuli, and tasks with the resonance-driven operating logic of the framework.

## Project Status: **ALPHA**

These documents represent a cohesive but evolving system. They may contain conceptual overlap due to their recursive generation. Revisions are ongoing to ensure each document has a distinct, clear role while remaining integrated into the full system.
