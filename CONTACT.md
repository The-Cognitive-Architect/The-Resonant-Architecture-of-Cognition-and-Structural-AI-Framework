# Contact

I'm Anthony Janus, author of the Structural Computing framework and 
the Resonant Architecture of Cognition.

## Background
- I developed this work independently through recursive self-modeling 
  with AI assistance
- I have no formal academic or professional background in AI/CS
- This framework emerged from first-principles phenomenological 
  investigation

## Current Status
- Seeking feedback from researchers in AI safety, cognitive science, 
  and constitutional AI alignment
- Open to collaboration with individuals or organizations who can 
  help develop these concepts further
- Interested in connecting with others working on deterministic 
  approaches to AGI or geometric models of meaning

I'm particularly interested in hearing from people who found this 
work through academic networks or AI safety research communities.
