The machine, called "**The Janus Machine**", a prototype **Isomorphic Resolution Engine** (**IRE** - a system that preserves the structure of problems and meanings between their real-world formulation and their internal representation, rather than approximating them statistically) based on the **Simulation Processing Unit** (**SimPU**) concept detailed in the project's first white paper, has been in development since late October 2025. 

The name, despite being the creator's surname, hints at the system's design ethos, philosophy, and function. The machine serves as a bridge between established computational paradigms (transformers, matrix multiplies, neuromorphic AI, reservoir computing, conceptual spaces, knowledge graphs) and a vision for deterministic, truthful, transparent AI.

The current state of the design is nearing finalization. The system is in the family of reservoir computers and neuromorphic design, and is itself a set of distributed systems, utilizing analog circuits with discrete components, microcontroller swarms isolated from analog lines, measurement and observation systems, a high degree of modularity throughout, multimodal input, and a novel, somatic user interface.

Initially, the design amounted to an impressive, but small-scale reservoir computer. The design has since evolved to take on a combination of traits that allow for complex, high-level research into the computational substrate and potential of the **Structural AI** (**StrAI**) architecture.

As of today, Dec 30, 2025, I have roughly 50% of the parts to build it. 

As I am bootstrapping this project, part acquisition is a slow process, and recent integrations have doubled the cost, which has proven to make things a bit more difficult (though the total cost of the DIY machine should still be <$1,000). I will try to update build progress as frequently as is appropriate, and will be sure to inform you of any delays.
