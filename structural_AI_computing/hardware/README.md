# Info

- This folder contains information regarding the SimPU hardware prototype, as it is released publicly.  

- Build details are beginning to roll out, but please give me time as the design currently lives in my head and is quite complex to be held in memory. I will update this repo with more information as I am able. Thank you for your understanding.
