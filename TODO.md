# Project Roadmap & TODO(High-Level)

Status: Pre-Alpha / Foundational Phase
This document outlines the high-level roadmap. Specific technical details for many items are proprietary and withheld.

---

## Phase 0: Foundational Architecture (Complete)

- [x] Establish core cognitive framework(The Resonant Architecture of Cognition)

- [x] Publish initial whitepaper for Structural AI(v2.3)

- [x] Release alignment layer proof-of-concept(chamber.py)

- [x] Outline hardware path(SimPU initial concept)

---

## Phase 1: Intellectual Property Formalization (In Progress)

1. SimPU Architecture - Formalization
    - Status: In Progress
    - Description: Formalize the SimPU architecture with detailed component diagrams, data flow models, and operational specifications for IP protection.
    - **Note: Provisional patent application for core concepts is in preparation.**

## Phase 2: Advanced Capabilities (Proprietary Roadmap)

This phase represents a significant expansion of the publicly documented paradigm. All architectural constructs are withheld as trade secrets.

1. Grounded Reasoning Framework
    - Status: Conceptualized / Design Phase
    - Description: Architectural extensions to ground abstract reasoning in non-symbolic data streams.

2. Longitudinal Coherence Models
    - Status: Conceptualized / Design Phase
    - Description: Mechanisms for maintaining state and context across extended operational timelines.

3. Phase 2 Whitepaper
    - Status: Planned
    - Description: A follow-on paper detailing the architecture for these advanced capabilities.
    - Viability: High.

## Phase 3: Implementation & Validation (Planned)

1. "Toy Universe" Geometric Engine - PoC

    - Status: Scoping / Pre-development
    - Description: Develop a minimal, end-to-end geometric engine to validate the "Meaning Painting" process in a constrained domain(e.g., symbolic logic, simple physics).
    - Dependency: Requires engineering team with expertise in analog circuit simulation or computational geometry.
