# Project Roadmap & TODO (High-Level)

**Status**: Pre-Alpha / Foundational Phase
This document outlines the high-level roadmap. Specific technical details for many items are proprietary and withheld.

---

## Phase 0: Foundational Architecture (Complete)

- [x] Establish core cognitive framework(The Resonant Architecture of Cognition)

- [x] Publish initial whitepaper for Structural AI(v2.3)

- [x] Release alignment layer proof-of-concept(chamber.py)

- [x] Outline hardware path(SimPU initial concept)

## Phase 1: Intellectual Property Formalization (In Progress)

1. ***SimPU Architecture - Formalization***
    - **Status**: In Progress
    - **Description**: Formalize the SimPU architecture with detailed component diagrams, data flow models, and operational specifications for IP protection.
    - **Note: Provisional patent application for core concepts is in preparation.**

## Phase 2: Advanced Capabilities (Proprietary Roadmap)

This phase represents a significant expansion of the publicly documented paradigm. All architectural constructs are withheld as trade secrets.

1. ***Grounded Reasoning Framework***
    - **Status**: Conceptualized / Design Phase
    - **Description**: Architectural extensions to ground abstract reasoning in non-symbolic data streams.
    - **Viability**: **High to Very High**

2. ***Longitudinal Coherence Models***
    - **Status**: Conceptualized / Design Phase
    - **Description**: Mechanisms for maintaining state and context across extended operational timelines.
    - **Viability**: **Very High**

3. ***Phase 2 Whitepaper***
    - **Status**: Planned
    - **Description**: A follow-on paper detailing the architecture for these advanced capabilities.

## Phase 3: System Integration (Planned)

1. ***Unified Architecture Blueprint***

    - **Status**: Conceptualized
    - **Description**: Develop the comprehensive blueprint for integrating the SimPU, Grounded Reasoning Framework, and Longitudinal Coherence Models into a single, cohesive architecture. This represents the full, end-state vision of the StrAI paradigm.
    - **Dependency**: Completion of Phase 1 and core design of Phase 2 components.

---

## Phase 4: Implementation & Validation (Planned)

1. ***"Toy Universe" Geometric Engine - PoC***

    - **Status**: Scoping / Pre-development
    - **Description**: Develop a minimal, end-to-end geometric engine to validate the "Meaning Painting" process in a constrained domain(e.g., symbolic logic, simple physics).
    - **Dependency**: Requires engineering team with expertise in analog circuit simulation or computational geometry.
