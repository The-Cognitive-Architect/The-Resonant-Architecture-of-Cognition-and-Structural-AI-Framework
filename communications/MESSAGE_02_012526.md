# "My Brain Hurts..." - A Status Update
_Date: 01/25/2026_

_NOTE: I was hoping to get this finished before I passed out, but there’s just too much to document in one sitting. I’m publishing this now as Part 1 (approx. 5:45 AM CST) and will finish it once I wake up this afternoon. Thank you for your understanding._

Hello Everyone,

It's been almost a month since my last letter, and what a month it has been.

The machine's design has seen substantial upgrades over the last month, and if I'm being honest, I don't know how I'm holding it all in my brain. This project has become my every day, and I work from upon waking until I can't keep my eyes open anymore. 

What began as a build with a few hundred parts has exploded into something that is more like an industrial-grade distributed system with thousands of components and tens of thousands of pins/solder points. My initial expectation to have test results for you by Q1 of this year (2026) was, again, a grossly optimistic timeline.

As I've said before, I have no background in any of these disciplines outside of some basic hobby projects. As a single individual, I am making progress as quickly as I can without sacrificing care and caution. The goal has been and will continue to be to design and build a machine that provides empirical data that can be trusted. 

I've managed to find ways of sourcing parts, despite lack of funding, and will continue to do what I can to see this through to the end. But I have to admit, as tiring and stressful as it may be, there's something about the process that's incredibly rewarding and validating.

I must admit, though, I'm at a point where I don't think my brain can maintain this momentum without taking some time to recharge. I will likely take short breaks of a day or three every week or two to prevent burnout, but will commit to uploading updates before each break happens. After I deliver this letter to you all, I'll be focusing on getting every finalized circuit written into the text schematic and get that uploaded to you all. 

I'm excited to share the progress that's been made with you, and I hope the big picture is beginning to come into view for you as clearly as I've been able to see it.

I can't actually be sure what stage the machine was at when I wrote my last letter to you, so the list below may include things you've already known about.

## Definitions
- **"Physics of Conceptual Hyperspace"** - In plain terms: the firmware defines local control laws so nodes self-stabilize, rather than being micromanaged.

## Improvements/Upgrades/Fixes/Changes
The system has been improved by implementing the following systems:

### Voltage - The 5V Paradigm

- Originally, I designed the mesh to operate at ±9V, however I then learned that certain parts required an overhead on their output. This caused me to drop the voltage to ±7V, however this became a complication elsewhere in the machine.

- The final decision was made to drop the voltage to a clean ±5V range, resulting in a 10V maximum delta across the mesh. This is easier to work with and safer for some of the components that will be touched by that signal. It is also more intuitive and easier to calculate mentally, as well as having a greater compatibility with various components, both present and future.

### The Moat - Galvanic Isolation

- **Parts**:

    - **CA-IS3741LN** - _Digital Isolator 3750Vrms Forward 3 Channel Reverse 1 Channel 150Mbps 150kV/us CMTI SOIC-16_
    - **CA-IS3020G** - _150kV/us SOIC-8-WB Digital Isolators RoHS_
    - **MCP3201-CI/SN** - _2.7V 12-Bit A/D Converter with SPI Serial Interface -40℃~+85℃ SPI 2.7V~5.5V 100kHz SOIC-8 Analog to Digital Converters (ADC) RoHS_

- Digital and Analog are now truly separated into hard power/ground islands per node, with isolators handling crossings.

- The original Corsair TX750W PSU has been dedicated to the Digital side and for powering components like LEDs that have higher current requirements.

- Two Mean Well-style 12V300W PSUs are now used to generate the +12V and -12V rails that will be fed into LM7809 and LM337T voltage regulators to create the +9V and -9V rails used by the LM358P op-amps to drive the mesh within the ±5V range at their respective nodes.

- Due to the fact that true galvanic isolation is now a firm design constraint, the MCP3201-CI/SN ADC is used to maintain the ATTINY's ability to read its node's voltage, which is a critical aspect of the design upon which many other subsystems rely.

- This makes the analog behavior trustworthy (less digital ground noise contaminating observations).

- It increases parts count and wiring complexity, but reduces ambiguity.

### Neuron Swarm - Independent Node Controllers 

- **Parts**:

    - **ATTINY1616-SN** - _IC MCU 8BIT 16KB FLASH 20SOIC_

- Every node is now given its own ATTINY1616 microcontroller. This MCU's job is not to be a programmed worker, but instead, to act as a "Physics Manager" and "Communications Facilitator".

-  Its programming is not intended to be "if/else" statements or other sequential instructions, but to be the "laws of conceptual hyperspace" so that when schemas are loaded into the mesh, each node self-regulates to maintain equilibrium, triggering adjustments to its identity voltage, link resistance, and capacitor bank value.

- Its other role is to receive instructions from the control hierarchy (higher level controllers, other nodes' ATTINYs, sensor values as voltage schemas) and inject those adjustments into the mesh through the same three mechanisms. These include both "passive" data like how environmental sensors impact cognitive quality, and "active" data like operator decisions and embodiment inputs (ie: self-observation of the RGB visualization system as schema overlays).

### The Swarm Remembers - Short-Term Memory 

- **Parts**:

    - **ESP-PSRAM64H** - _IC PSRAM 64MBIT SPI 133MHZ 8SOIC_

- Every node is given its own 64Mbit PSRAM chip. This chip's role is to provide a short-term "working memory" where node state data is constantly being written, utilized for short-term self-regulation, and pulled in batches to be sent to the long-term storage controller via the control hierarchy for vectorization and storage (compression to save space for long-term storage on HDDs).

- The ATTINY1616 MCUs can send requests for state snapshots from long-term storage and load them into PSRAM as a form of "neuronal recall" to apply prior states to current states.

### The Sound of Mind - Parallel Acoustic Mesh

- **Parts**:

    - **GMI9767P-60DB** - _Omnidirectional -60dB 2.2kΩ 58dB Through Hole,D=9.7mm Microphones RoHS_
    - **20MM-8Ω1W-L60MM** - _5% 8Ω Electromagnetic 900Hz 88dB 1W Speakers RoHS_
    - **LM386N(XBLW)** - _1-Channel Class AB DIP-8 Audio Amplifiers RoHS_
    - **PT2259-S** - _Volume Control I2C SOIC-8 Audio Special Purpose RoHS_
    - **SN74LVC1G66DBVR(UMW)** - _Single Analog Switch 5.5Ω 1 1:1 SOT-23-5 Analog Switches, Multiplexers, Demultiplexers RoHS_

- This system is designed to generate a parallel acoustic mesh. The node voltage is read using a voltage follower circuit and routed through an audio amplifier to a speaker. 

- This speaker is enclosed in a 3D printed acoustic channel, connecting it to its neighbors' condenser microphones while also emitting sound through holes surrounding the speaker to allow an observer to hear each node's output.

- This audio is picked up by neighboring nodes' condenser microphones, read by those nodes' ATTINYs, and reinjected into the mesh via the three core self-regulation mechanisms available to each node. The type of injection is dictated by the "physics of conceptual hyperspace" and the node's current state, from subtle amplification, negation, or total override.

- As the PT2259-S has two channels, the second channel is routed to a summing circuit (yet to be designed) and played through external speakers as a composite mesh audio signal.

### The Turbine Engines - Unilateral Influence Links

- In the original design, each node was connected by a semi-passive bi-directional link where directionality was determined by which node's voltage was higher between the two. This allowed for passive settling across the mesh, but lacked the ability to impose directional influence from a node with a lower voltage to a node with a higher voltage.

- A Turbine Link is constructed similarly to the passive links, however, Turbines are fed via a voltage follower on its own ±5V rails, allowing for a node to influence another without back propagation. This provides unilateral links that can be independently turned on or off, and the strength of its connection modulated by a GL5537 LDR.

- These turbines are integrated into every link position between nodes, expanding the original 160 node<->node links to 480 total paths of influence. (_these are not implemented at the 25 identity links between a node and its Vsource_)

### Granular Precision - XL-502UWC White LED & PCM9956B LED Drivers

- **Parts**:

    - **XL-502UWC** - _White LED Indication - Discrete 3.3V Through Hole,D=5mm_
    - **PCM9956B** - _24-channel Fm+ I2C-bus constant current LED driver 31.25kHz 24 3V~5.5V TSSOP-38-EP LED Drivers ICs RoHS_

- In the previous link design, each LDR was controlled by a blue LED of unknown specifications. These LEDs were from a purchase made in 2015 for an LED cube project. Through testing, it was found that the blue light was not effective at producing the available resistance range that is desired for granular control, and so were discarded.

- New 20,000mcd LEDs in the cool white spectrum were ordered to replace them. These ultra bright LEDs allow for special light tunnel geometry to be used, in combination with PCM9956B LED drivers' PWM and current adjustability, to achieve a resistance range from hundreds of ohms all the way to megaohms.
