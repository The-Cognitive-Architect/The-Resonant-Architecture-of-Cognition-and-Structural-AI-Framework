# A Message to Those Who May Be Watching

Hello,

I'd like to start off by thanking you for taking the time to visit this repository. Your interest in the project is appreciated more than I can say.

As the project has seen some real progress behind the scenes, I thought it would be a good time to address you and begin a line of communication. I'll be working on the repo structure over the coming weeks to provide ways to ask questions, contribute, and have discussions on the project, though I anticipate traffic will be low until the machine is finished.

I had posted a line in the repo's readme in December indicating the hardware would be coming by end of year. Unfortunately, that was... a very ambitious timeframe.

The design has continued to evolve in the time since, during which some of the most important capabilities were conceived. As such, it has become apparent that I will not have a finished machine by end of year. 

Resources are low, considering my bootstrapped status, but efforts are being made to acquire the remaining components required for the build. 

I will aim for a Q1 2026 release, which is a tight timeframe, but to get to an assembled machine that doesn't blow up, it's doable, barring any unexpected complications. However, given the immense amount of code that is required once built, I expect initial research to begin by late Q1 to mid-Q2.

## Where we're going...
Regarding the future of the project...

If the thesis behind the concept proves to be correct, then this architecture has vast potential, especially in truth-centered domains. The applications for a deterministic **Isomorphic Resolution Engine** (**IRE** - a system that preserves the structure of problems and meanings between their real-world formulation and their internal representation, rather than approximating them statistically) in law, medicine, and safety-critical infrastructure are numerous, and needed. 

The end goal here is to build, and to keep building. The industry is desperate for a solution to the difficult problems with probabilistic AI. The architecture of transformers is predictive at its core, and even if our bolted-on solutions bring failure rates down to 0.001%, that 1 in 100,000 fail-state has the potential to be catastrophic.

We need a system that doesn't predict, that doesn't guess, but knows whether its response is both coherent and meaningful. We need a system that is motivationally driven, that it has a reason to perform the task accurately and comprehensively. We need a system that is structurally aligned with human interests, and can understand the nuances that facilitate compassionate accuracy in the complexity of dynamic systems. 

And we need systems that can "feel" understanding come into focus.

I believe this project has the potential to become not a replacement to the Von Neumann paradigm, but its complement. We do precise decision making very well, but a human is still needed to manage and direct the machine. A human is still needed when an ethical decision must be made.

Digital computation has the capacity for great capability, but it lacks a reason, it lacks meaning. I believe this project is the superego and the id to Von Neumann's and Turing's ego; the heartbeat giving tempo to a system that's just begging to dance. 

## So... 
I have yet to decide if I will be patenting, releasing as open-source, or something in between.

I believe in transparency, and in respect to that, I must be honest and inform any who read this that I am not in the professional world, I do not have an education in related fields, and the entire process from The Resonant Architecture of Cognition to this build has been done from first principles. 

This project for me is survival as much as it is contribution; it is purpose as much as it is a solution. Without getting into personal details, this project is a light in the dark for its creator as much as it is an effort to illuminate the darkness for a world strained by complexity. 

What I can promise is that any path forward will prioritize making this architecture accessible as much as is possible, even if through hybrid models or creative licensing.

Until a decision has been made, updates will be more vague than I'm sure you'd like them to be, and I apologize for that. It's just me working on this, and I do not have the expertise, experience, or network to guide me in these decisions. To seek legal counsel on limited resources, I need something of value to show, something novel that can be demonstrated, with enough promise to be worthwhile.

However, while I can’t share technical details yet, I’ll still keep this repo visibly alive with progress markers.

So expect updates that inform of progress, but are sparse on technicals for now. As things progress and perhaps opportunities present themselves, then I hope to be able to show more.

So, to all of you watching, all of you reading... 

I see you. 

Thank you for your support. It means something to me.
